I discussed certain concepts with Karsh Tharyani, and he helped explain why certain parts of my code were not yielding the correct answer. These explanations mainly include spotting a very common mistake, which was to multiply the Prior with the sum of log likelihoods. 

Karsh explained in a very general way, being very careful as to not give me any explicit answers, and instead questioned my intuition and allowed me to arrive at the answers myself.
